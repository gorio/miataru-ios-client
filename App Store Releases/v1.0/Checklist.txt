App Name: 

Miataru - be found

App Description:

Miataru or 見当たる is Japanese and means "be found" or "to come across" and it's meant to be a set of tools to allow the user to track locations and choose how to work with the data as well as how data is stored if at all.

When Google closed it’s Latitude service it suddenly became apparent how many processes in an home automation system and daily life already make use of the ability to locate devices.

This is the Miataru iOS App that allows you to use the free Miataru service or your own Miataru server instance.
